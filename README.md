# Installation

# Features
The user is able to which physical model(s) to solve among those below:

#### Operationnal
  - Multi-dimension
  - Tritium diffusion
  - Heat transfers (conduction)
  - Temperature dependence of diffusion coefficients
  - Tritium radioactive decay
  - Off-gassing
  - Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions

#### Work in progress ...
  - Trapping/detraping 1D
  - Trap creation processes 1D

#### ToDo
